              For this image, I chose an image from unsplash.com, using the search 
              terms "performance art". The goal was to subtly retouch the image
              so it would fit as a square on the "What's On" page.
              <br>
              To achieve this, I took the following steps/decisions:
              <br>
              <ul>
                <li>The colour balance was retouched by using an adjustment layer on Affinity Photo, which made
                  the image warmer and add a bit more coolness to the background and make the
                  performer's faces look less washed out or yellow toned.
                  The colour balance was shifted slightly towards Cyan, Magenta and Blue to achieve this.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The image was cropped to a square, focusing on the performers in the middle.
                  This was necessary was the page where the image sits contains rows of squared images.
                  </li>
                <li>I saved it as a JPEG, as the quality did not need to be extremely high as 
                  it sat quite small within my mock-up (as it would on the live website), 
                  and it allowed for a smaller file size,
                   which would result in a faster loading time on a real website.
                   On the website, I would inlcude it as a progressive JPEG for accessibility 
                   and because it is an icon on the webpage rather than a whole image to be seen on a full page.

              For this image, I chose an image from unsplash.com, using the search 
              terms "drawing". The goal was to subtly retouch the image
              so it would fit as a square on the "What's On" page.
              The person drawing would allude to participation and creation which I thought 
              appropriate to represent "Open Calls".
              <br>
I took the following steps/decisions:
              <br>
              <ul>
                <li>The colour balance was retouched by using an adjustment layer on Affinity Photo, which made
                  the image less yellow-toned and more photographic looking.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The image was cropped to a square, similarly to the previous image.
                  </li>
                <li>I saved it as a JPEG, as the quality did not need to be extremely high as 
                  it sat quite small within my mock-up (as it would on the live website), 
                  and it allowed for a smaller file size,

                For this image, I chose an image that I took myself a few years ago
                at the Zaha Hadid Roca London Gallery.
                In this context, I'm using it as a fictional representation of the library space
                 for this gallery. 
                <br>
                I took the following steps/decisions:
                <br>
                <ul>
                  <li> I smoothed out some details with the clone tool to make the image clearer.
                  </li>
                  <li> I subtly adjusted the colour balance to make the image a little bit warmer.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The image was cropped to a square.

              For this image, I chose an image from unsplash.com. The goal was to make the
              image very dramatic and appear artistic.
              <br>
              To achieve this, I took the following steps/decisions:
              <br>
              <ul>
                <li> I added noise to give it a grainy texture, with a "new live filter layer"
                </li>
                <li>
                  I adjusted the colour balance and used the "soft light" option 
                  to make the colours more vibrant.
                  </li>
                <li>I saved it as a JPEG, as the quality did not need to be extremely high as

              For this image, I chose a poster from unsplash.com. The goal was to make the image look more graphic for
              it to stand out better on the website home page.
              <br>
              To achieve this, I took the following steps/decisions:
              <br>
              <ul>
              
                <li>
                  I sharpened the image using an adjustment layer. I then fixed the image hue to make it less yellow and 
                  more photographic by adjusting the colour balance,
                  as well as the vibrance and saturation levels.

                For this image, I created a background image for my 2 content pages mockups.

                To achieve this, I took the following steps/decisions:
                <br>
                <ul>
                  <li> I created the image in Adobe XD as it is a very helpful
                    software that allowed me to create a web-sized image.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    I created the image with the Adobe XD tools and icon libraries.
                    </li>
                  <li>Because
                    I'm using lines and geometrical shapes and I need this image to be high wuality,
                    I saved it as an SVG, which would allow for a high quality image that would not lose 
                    its quality, and I would be able to re-purpose it and use it for
                    all the pages of my website.
                  </li>
                  <li>The SVG is 8KB</li>
